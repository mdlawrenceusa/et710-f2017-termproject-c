							<p>A freak show is an exhibition of biological rarities, referred to as "freaks of nature". Typical features would be physically
								 unusual humans, such as those uncommonly large or small, those with both male and female secondary sexual characteristics,
								 people with other extraordinary diseases and conditions, and performances that are expected to be shocking to the viewers.
								 Heavily tattooed or pierced people have sometimes been seen in freak shows, as have attention-getting physical performers
								 such as fire-eating and sword-swallowing acts.</p>



							<p> n the mid-16th century, freak shows became popular pastimes in England.[1] Deformities began to be treated as objects of
								interest and entertainment, and the crowds flocked to see them exhibited. A famous early modern example was the exhibition at
								 the court of Charles I of Lazarus and Joannes Baptista Colloredo, two conjoined brothers born in Genoa, Italy. While Lazarus
								 was handsome and functioning, his parasitic brother just dangled before him in a mass of limbs from his chest. When Lazarus wa
								 s not exhibiting himself, he covered his brother with his cloak to avoid unnecessary attention.
As well as crazy exhibitions, freak shows were popular in the taverns and fairgrounds where the freaks were often combined with talent
displays. For example, in the 18th century, Matthias Buchinger, born without arms or lower legs, entertained crowds with astonishing displays of
 magic and musical ability, both in England and later, Ireland.  </p>

<p> There were four ways freak shows were produced and marketed. The first was the oral spiel or lecture. This featured a showman or professor who managed the presentation of the people or “freaks”. The second was a printed advertisement usually using long pamphlets and broadside or newspaper advertisement of the freak show. The third step included costuming, choreography, performance, and space used to display the show, designed to emphasize the things that were considered abnormal about each performer. The final stage was a collectable drawing or photograph that portrayed the group of freaks on stage for viewers to take home. The collectable printed souvenirs were accompanied by recordings of the showmen’s pitch, the lecturer’s yarn, and the professor’s exaggerated accounts of what was witnessed at the show. Exhibits were authenticated by doctors who used medical terms that many could not comprehend but which added an air of authenticity to the proceedings. Freak show culture normalized a specific way of thinking about gender, race, sexual aberrance, ethnicity, and disability.[8]
Scholars[who?] believe that freak shows contributed significantly to the way American culture views nonconforming bodies. Freak shows were a space for the general public to scrutinize bodies different from their own, from dark-skinned people, to victims of war and diseases, to ambiguously sexed bodies.[8] People felt that paying to view these “freaks” gave them permission to compare themselves favorably to the freaks.[9]
During the first decade of the twentieth century the popularity of the freak show was starting to dwindle.[10] In their prime, freak shows had been the main attraction of the midway, but by 1940 they were starting to lose their audience, with credible people turning their backs on the show.[11] In the nineteenth century science supported and legitimized the growth of freak shows, but by the twentieth century, the medicalization of human abnormalities contributed to the end of the exhibits' mystery and appeal.</p>
