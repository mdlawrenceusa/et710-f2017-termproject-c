			<h2> The Elephant Man </h2>

			<p>
			Joseph Carey Merrick (5 August 1862 – 11 April 1890), often incorrectly called John Merrick, was an English man with very severe deformities who was
			first exhibited at a freak show as the "Elephant Man", and then went to live at the London Hospital after he met Frederick Treves, subsequently
			becoming well known in London society. Merrick was born in Leicester, and began to develop abnormally during the first few years of his life:
			his skin appeared thick and lumpy, he developed enlarged lips, and a bony lump grew on his forehead, one of his arms and both of his feet became
			enlarged and at some point during his childhood he fell and damaged his hip, resulting in permanent lameness. When he was 9, his mother died
			from bronchopneumonia, and his father soon remarried. Merrick left school at the age of 13 and had difficulty finding employment. Rejected by
			 his father and stepmother, he left home. In late 1879, Merrick, aged 17, entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.
			</p>
			<h1>  The autopsy showed that Merrick had died of a dislocated neck. it is believed that Merrick, who had to sleep
			 sitting up because of the weight of his head, had been attempting to sleep lying down to <b>"be like other people".</b></h1>

										<p>Grady Stiles</p>
										<h2>Lobster Boy</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Grady Franklin Stiles Jr. (June 26, 1937 – November 29, 1992) was a freak show performer. His deformity was ectrodactyly, in which the fingers
										and toes are fused together to form claw-like extremities. Stiles' stage name was the "Lobster Boy"
										.</p>
										<p>The Stiles family had a long history of ectrodactyly. Stiles was the sixth in a line that began with the birth
											 of William Stiles in 1805. Grady Stiles' father was a sideshow attraction in a traveling carnival when his son
											 was born and added his son to the act at a young age.[1] Stiles married twice and had four children, two of whom
											 also had ectrodactyly. Stiles and his two children toured together as The Lobster Family. When not traveling with
											 the carnival the Stiles family lived in Gibsonton, Florida where many other carnival performers lived during the winter season. </p>
										<img src="images/lobster.jpg">
										<p> Stiles was an alcoholic and was abusive to his family.[1] Due to his ectrodactyly, he was unable to walk. While he often used a wheelchair,
											 he most commonly used his hands and arms for locomotion. He developed substantial upper body strength that, when combined with his bad temper
											 and alcoholism, made him dangerous to others.
In 1988 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Stiles shot and killed his oldest daughter's fiancé on the eve of their wedding. He was brought to trial, where he openly
confessed to killing the man and was convicted of third degree murder.[2][3] He was not sent to prison as no state institution was equipped to care for an inmate
 with ectrodactyly. Stiles was instead sentenced to fifteen years probation.
Stiles stopped drinking thereafter, and during this period remarried his first wife, Mary Teresa (Teresa). However, he soon began drinking again and his family
claimed that he became even more abusive. In 1992, Teresa and her son from a previous marriage, Harry Glenn Newman Jr., hired a seventeen-year-old sideshow performer
named Chris Wyant to kill Stiles for $1500.</p>
